# SpaceX Data React App - Completed Assessment

This repository contains the solution for building a React app to share SpaceX data with the world. Below, you'll find information about the project, how to run the app, and details about my solution.

## Project Overview

This React app is designed to showcase SpaceX data in an interactive and user-friendly manner. The app fetches data from the SpaceX API and presents it on a landing page. The landing page consists of a modern banner, a search form with multiple filters, and a paginated data grid.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.

The app should now be running locally and can be accessed at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Solution Details

### Technologies Used

- React: The core framework used to build the user interface and manage the application's state.
- Tailwind CSS: Used for styling components and creating a responsive design.
- Redux Toolkit: Used for managing global state and sharing data between components.
- Jest: Used for writing and running unit tests.

### Implementation Highlights

- **Components:** The app is organized into reusable components, following best practices for component structure and composition.
- **Search Form:** The search form includes three filters (status, original_launch, and type) and provides real-time search results based on user input.
- **Data Grid:** The paginated data grid displays the fetched data in a user-friendly manner. Clicking on an item opens a popup with detailed information.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to be responsive and user-friendly across different screen sizes and browsers.
- **Speed Optimization:** The React app is optimized for quick loading times to ensure a smooth user experience.

### Test Cases

While test cases were not mandatory, I have included a comprehensive set of Jest unit tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of key components and features.

## Conclusion

Thank you for considering my submission for the SpaceX Data React App assessment. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and applying my skills to create a functional and visually appealing app. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and further enhance this project.
